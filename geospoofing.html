        <h1>Geo-Spoofing Detection</h1>
        <p>Started: June 2021</p>
        <p>Status: Completed as of August 2021</p>
        <p>Geo-Spoofing occurs when someone connects to a VPN to disguise their location when connecting to a server. This can be a huge problem for media sharing companies such as Netflix that have different content in each reason. 
            In this project myself as well as other researchers at the University at Houston tackle this issue.</p>
        <p>To set up our experiment we launched instances on AWS across the world in locations such as South Korea, Germany, and the United States. 
            Instances were either clients, VPNs, or servers.</p>
        <p>Using PyShark, a Python wrapper for tshark (Wireshark), we are able to read incoming packets and perform live analysis on them on the server. The script follows the below psuedocode.</p>
        <div class="code-container"><pre><code><span style="color:orange">IF</span> packet has <span style="color:blue">SYN</span> flag AND sent to server
    store client IP address <span style="color:white">[i]</span>
<span style="color:orange">IF</span> packet has <span style="color:blue">SYN ACK</span> flag AND sent from server

<span style="color:orange">IF</span> packet has <span style="color:blue">ACK</span> flag AND sent to server
