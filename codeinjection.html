        <p>Start Date: October 2023</p>
        <p>Status: In progress</p>
        <p>The project's objective is to create a virus that infects all executables 
            in the target directory. When those executables are ran the virus's payload runs before the normal program. 
            Attempting to insert code into the main function of the ELF file will corrupt the ELF file most likely causing it to seg fault. 
            However, injecting it to a precise location and changing a few values in the ELF file as well, we can accomplish this goal.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Virus Payload
        </h2>
        <p>This virus contains a payload that will send an HTTP POST request to this web server. The web server logs the time and date in a database for users to view. 
            You can see all timestamps <a href="/projects/code-injections/timestamps">here</a>. At the end of the payload an instructions jumps back to the start of the program, and begins to execute.</p>
        <h2>
            Virus Infection Method
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to add the payload to the targeted file, we must first edit values that will both allow the virus to run while also preserving the original functionality of the code.
            First, we need to find a place to inject the code so that it doesn't interfere with any other segment. Most ELF files contain segments of executable code with ammounts of room between the end of this segment and another segment.
            If there is enough virtual address space that fits the size of the payload we can inject it into this location. 
            Most ELF files have sections padded with zeros at the end of the data for that section. 
            Lastly, we change the entry point to point to the location of the virus.
        </p>
            <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>You can download and run the virus in the given VM (recommended) or download the virus as is.</p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>In the current directory where the virus is installed enter: python3 inject.py in the terminal.</p>
            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>With ELF files, you are unable to simply put the code in the text section of the ELF. This will cause the program to segfault. Other edits are necessary.</p>
            <p>To solve this, I researched the format of ELF files and determined most of the problem was coming from misaligned offets due to the change of size in the file.
            My first step was to succesfully inject code into a hello world program.
            </p>
            <p> 
                There are multiple places one can inject the malicious code. I did some experimentation with injecting code directly into the .text section of code specifically the main function. 
                I was able to determine what offsets and values needed to be changed in order to prevent the file from corrupting.
                However, this method would prove to be invalid as sometimes the virtual address that I changed were used in computations within the code section that now yield different answers.
            </p>
            <h2>Timestamps</h2>

            <p>The timestamps you see include all times the injected code ran successfully in an effected file. This is the only information that can be displayed as the virus does not capture any info. You can run the effected application and then view this page to see a timestamps that should match when you started the program if the code was succesfully ran.</p>
