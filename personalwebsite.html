        <h1>Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Start Date: September 2023</p>
        <p>Status: In Progess</p>
        <p>This is the site you are currently viewing!</p>
        <p>I set up this website on my home network on Ubuntu Server. To host the web server, I used nginx as well as NodeJS.</p>
        <p>Most of the content on my website is static, however, I have created an interactive feature which allows users to enter 
            JLang code and are given an output. To implement this feature I added functionality that clicking the 'RUN' button sends a POST request to my web server 
            the body of which contains the code the user writes. The server handles this request by creating a file and then compiling and running the file.
            The server sends back the compiling result if there is an error or sends the output to the code if compilation was successful. 

            One difficulty, I ran into prevented multiple requests from different clients writing to the same file on the server. As an attempt to fix
            this I created the files based on the IP address of the request. This led to another problem as I was unable to capture the IP address
            of the client due to nginx's lack of functionality for web servers hosted on virtual machines. To combat this, I decided to handle requests 
            through cookies rather than IP address. I randomly generated an ID for a client which would translate to the name of the file to be created for compilation and executing.
            The benefit of this method is that two clients on the same network with the same IP address will have different files to manipulate as they will have different cookie values.
